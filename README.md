# call-centre
This project was done as part of PwC's virtual case experience program. The task was to create a power BI dashboard for analyzing the call centre performance of a telecom client. They needed transparency and insight into their call centre data. For example: overall customer satisfaction, total number of calls answered and abandoned, speed of answer, length of calls, etc. Accordingly, the dashboard was created reflecting all the relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics.
Possible KPIs include (but not limited to):

Overall customer satisfaction
Overall calls answered/abandoned
Calls by time
Average speed of answer
Agentâ€™s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered

Insights :
As shown by Data Visualization, It can be deduced that:

Most of the satisfaction ratings from each call are 3 and 4.
The average satisfaction rating has decreased over the span of three months. January brought the highest satisfaction rating and march the lowest.
The percentage of issue resolved in January was the highest, with a dip in February. It increased again in march.
The majority of calls come in the morning.
The average speed of answer by Joe is the highest.
The call resolution rate of Jim is the highest, even though the average speed of his answers is lower compared to those of Joe, Martha and Dan. The call answered by - him are also higher than the average number of calls answered.
Becky's speed of answer is the lowest among all, and her rate of calls resolved is higher. She is in the 5th position in the call resolution rate.
Martha has the highest speed of answered in the sec
